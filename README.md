# FVCOM_BIO

For these bio models, I am rewriting so all of them can use the same mod_bio_3D.F.

WARNING: this is work in progress.  In particular, since I am trying the above, when I update one model I may break another.  I will make a tagged version when everything is fine.

One more thing: Don't Use CGEM.  GitHub is so I don't lose work in progress, not because it works.
